### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**anavsky** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ user because she will post some âœ¨ _amazing_ âœ¨ projects (anytime in the future, I still haven't been defeated by the exhausting routine of dev, so I have lots of hope hehe).
Stay tuned!

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my web development skills.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning html, css, java script for front-end and node.js for back-end.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learn as go, so things here will be constantly changing.
